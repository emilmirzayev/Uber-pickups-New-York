I am a heavy UBER user. Where I grew up, UBER is very cheap in comparison to other taxis. That's why, when knowing that there is a dataset concerning UBER I became thrilled.
This time, I will analyse UBER rides on NYC for the time period of April 1-30, 2014. Data was downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city.

This dataset contains data about:
1) Date and time of an order
2) Geo location of the client
3) Which base did that taxi belong

First, I will have some initial look at the data. Namely, I will analyse the daily and hourly ride statistics. Then I will look at more general level. Lastly, I will use geo data to visualize orders in NYC using Basemap toolkit.
